## The Details

### Structure of the project

```
contracts                → Ethereum contract source code (solidity language) + compile script
 └ compiled              → Compiled contracts (binary + abi).
src                      → Home of Java sources (Maven style directory layout)
src-gen                  → Home of generated sources (produced by mvn clean package)
wallet                   → The cryptographic wallet containing the user credentials (public/private key)
```

The compiled contracts and the generated files (see above) are checked in into Github, so you don't have to cope with contract development for now.

### Main classes

* `com.hshnordbank.util.DeploymentExample` deploys a contract to the blockchain
* `com.hshnordbank.util.ListSSDs` prints the contracts of a specific user to the console
